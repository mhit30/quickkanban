## AI Copilot (LLM Integration)

QuickKanban includes a real-time **AI Copilot** that delivers task insights
as your board updates using a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) pipeline. All queries first go through the Express.js backend API.

- Embeds task updates using **Gemini** LLM embeddings
- Stores and retrieves vectors with **Qdrant**
- AI summaries, suggestions, and insights are **streamed to user within ~500ms**
- A **contextual thread** is maintained between Gemini and user using **Redis**
- **Gemini and Qdrant** interactions are served through dedicated **FastAPI microservices**

As users add more tasks, the AI Copilot can provide deeper insights for the expanding board - enabling dynamic reasoning and memory.

## Features

- ‚ö° **Real-time updates** using WebSockets (Socket.IO)
- ü§ñ **AI Copilot Assistant** that summarizes and reasons about tasks in real time
- üß† **RAG-based vector search** powered by Gemini + Qdrant
- üßµ **LLM memory and thread context** via Redis
- üë• **Live user presence tracking** in collaborative kanban rooms
- üñ±Ô∏è **Live cursor indicators** to show teammates' movements in real-time
- üìå Add tasks fluidly to boards; drag-and-drop with column transitions
- üíæ Persistent task storage with MongoDB

## System Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + Socket.IO for live collaboration and presence
- **Main API**: Node.js + Express + WebSockets
- **AI Microservices**: FastAPI-based embedder, retriever, and query services
- **Gemini + Qdrant**: RAG backend with embeddings + vector search
- **Redis**: Stores temporary conversational thread between the LLM and user and serves as a general cache for board
- **MongoDB**: Durable task + board storage

## Setup & Deployment

QuickKanban is fully containerized and deployed using AWS.

### Containerization

- Each service (backend, AI microservices, Redis, Nginx) runs in its own Docker container
- Containers are managed using ECS with EC2 launch type

### AWS Deployment

- **Amazon ECS (EC2 Launch Type):** Orchestrates microservices
- **Amazon EC2:** Hosts all running containers and mounts SSL certs
- **Amazon ECR:** Stores Docker images
- **Nginx:** Handles HTTPS and reverse proxies to backend

## Deployment files:

- `ecs-task-definition.json`
- `nginx.conf`
- `Dockerfile` (for both backend and Nginx)
